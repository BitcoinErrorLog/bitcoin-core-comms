Communications and outreach for Bitcoin Core

Bitcoin Core is an open source software project, that everyone can join and contribute code to. Hence, the communication side of core should be treated the same way, an open system where everyone knows whatâ€™s going on and can directly add their contributions, without any barriers to entry.

Through applying swarm methodologies in communications it's entirely possible to build an open source communication operation, empowering the community to contribute in terms of communications, in the same way the community has contributed in terms of code. 

This repository aims to collect graphic materials, best practices, and communications templates.
